Real Estate Housing Predictions in the city of Ames, Iowa using statistical modeling

## Importance of the Problem
In the highly competitive real estate industry, which boasts a monopoly of large brokerage firms, the small players need a considerable competitive advantage to stay relevant. In fact, individual sellers often fail to put a price on their property and most buyers struggle to shortlist a house based on a favorable trade-off between the characteristics that they look for in an ideal home and the price they are willing to pay. Even for a given location and time of the year, predicting trends in house prices is tough at the best.

There are a number of parameters that may impact the final sale price of a house. With a dataset that explores about 80 probable variables that may impact the final negotiable price of a house in the city of Ames, I attempt to shortlist the most determining variables. Once these important predictors are shortlisted, I would use these to create a model that can successfully predict the final sale price of a house.

This predictive model would prove to be useful for both buyers and sellers in arriving at a prediction of the most suitable price for the property under consideration.

## Objective
I would employ various data analysis techniques to predict the selling price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This can prove to be a good tool for sellers as they can analyze the prices of homes that they already own and for buyers who wish to purchase a new home. Currently, there are many options available to a buyer in the city and it is difficult to analyze the prices of homes. It is a cumbersome task to study every house on sale. Through this project, my aim is to predict the sales price of residential homes by considering the most important aspects (features) and determine the role they play in my decision.

## Scope
All the methods employed in this project implement regression techniques in data analysis studied throughout the semester of the Engineering Data Analytics course to help in predicting sales price of residential homes which is not available easily.
The techniques that I use are different regression methods such as multiple linear regression, shrinkage methods including ridge regression and LASSO and regression trees including bagging, random forest and boosting. These regression models were evaluated on the basis of the training data.
